# About

This is a hybrid content page managed locally through Astro Content Collections rather than WordPress. This approach allows for:

- Local content management for static pages
- Version control for important content
- Developer-friendly content workflow
- Hybrid content strategy (WordPress + local files)

## Why Hybrid Content?

Not all content needs to be managed through a CMS. Static content like about pages, legal pages, and documentation can often be more efficiently managed through local content files in your repository.

Benefits include:

- Version control
- Pull request reviews
- Easier collaboration
- No need for CMS access for simple updates
